I think that spring of 2019 is going to be a great year for Reno homebuyers. Here are my reasons why:

**1. We’ll see more listings come on the market.** I’ve had a lot of clients who would normally list their homes in January or February, but are instead waiting for the spring. For one thing, their landscaping will look much better with some spring green in it.

**2. Prices won’t likely decrease any time soon.** Prices are still going up, but much more slowly than they were. In my opinion, they’re not likely to drop in the near future. For those of you waiting for this price decline, I just don’t see it happening; all the economic indicators are showing that our market will continue to rise.

**3. Interest rates will likely increase over time.** For a while last year, interest rates skyrocketed into the low- to mid-5%-range, but they’ve come back down this year. I believe that they’ll slowly trickle upward as 2019 progresses, though. As interest rates go up, your buying power goes down, meaning that sooner is better than letter if you’re buying a home.

**4. There will be lots of new inventory on the market soon.** Over the next couple of months, we expect to see a massive influx of properties being listed.

For the first time in a long time, this spring will be a busy time for the Reno market. If you have questions or are thinking of buying a home this spring, by all means, reach out to me. It’s time to get out of the rental market and start looking for a home.
