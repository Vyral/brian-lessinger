Most of the time, my clients are looking for appreciation, cash flow, or both.

Today we’re back with No. 5 in our six-part series discussing the advantages of owning real estate. This time, we’re discussing the advantages of owning rental properties.

When people purchase rental properties, there are two things that they’re usually trying to accomplish:

1. Appreciation. This involves buying a property that’s either in need of work or in an up-and-coming area where we think prices are going to appreciate.

2. Monthly cash flow. A lot of this depends on the age and overall goals of the investor.

I’m always playing this game with my clients of appreciation versus cash flow. **If you’re lucky, you can get both, but most of the time you’re looking for one or the other.**

I have plenty of clients who we help that end up managing their own properties. However, if you don’t want to do that, my team can certainly help with property management and still get you that appreciation or cash flow that you’re looking for.

If you have any questions about your specific situation and how owning rental property might help you, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
