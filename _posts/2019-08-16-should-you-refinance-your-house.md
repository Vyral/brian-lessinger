Many of you probably already know that the Fed lowered the interest rate by 0.25% a few weeks ago for the first time since 2008. At that time, the market and housing industry was just a disaster, so this has been a big deal.

For many people, that rate adjustment is really beneficial for things like credit card debt, student loans, car payments, and other adjustable-rate payments.&nbsp;

**In the housing industry, however, I’ve been getting a lot of phone calls from people asking if now is the time to refinance their home. My advice is this:**

Before you refinance your house, ask yourself, “Why do I want to refinance my house?” Is it a matter of just wanting to lower your interest rate? Do you want to refinance a 30-year mortgage to a 10- or 15-year mortgage? Or are you trying to refinance so that you’re able to take some of the cash from the equity growth that you’ve had over the last five to 10 years?

The second question to ask yourself is, “What will it cost to refinance?” Let’s say that cost is going to be $10,000 and you’ll end up saving $250 a month on your payment. If you divide that $10,000 by 250, you get 40, meaning that it would take 40 months to recoup the cost of refinancing your home.&nbsp;

Those who aren’t sure how long you’re going to live in your house will need to consider these questions seriously. It’s not just a given that you’ll get a lower rate when you refinance; sometimes, there are values in that equation that require further discussion.

If you’re thinking of refinancing your home or doing a cash-out refinance, reach out to me. I would love to discuss whether refinancing is right for you.
