Today we’ll be looking at how to get your mortgage to a manageable position.

When you have a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, you’re paying a lot more in interest during your initial payments. It’s not a situation where the same amount goes to your principal and your interest each month over the life of the loan.

On average in 2018, people are only putting about 5% down on their homes. Most people are only staying in their homes for five or six years before moving; **the payments made during those years are mostly going toward interest instead of the principal.**

We have some tips to help you get a bigger amount of the principal when you go to sell or refinance your home. By following [this Excel tutorial](https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/loan-amortization-schedule.html) for a loan amortization schedule, you can see for yourself how much interest you’re paying versus principal, as well as the difference that extra payments could make. You may be surprised at how much less interest you’d pay and how many fewer payments you’d make by adding some money to each monthly payment. You can find some great ideas on lowering the interest you pay from [Brian Buffini’s podcast](https://www.thebrianbuffinishow.com/getting-the-mortgage-monkey-off-your-back-124/).
