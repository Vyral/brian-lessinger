Our client appreciation program is just one of the ways we provide value as a company. Here is how it works.

Today I am excited to talk about our client appreciation program and explain it in great detail. Here is how it works.

We have a database of contacts that is full of clients, friends, family, and all the people we have helped over the years. **Once a month, typically the first Thursday of the month, we mail everyone in our database an item of value.** In addition, there is a video and email that goes along with that item. It is not always strictly real-estate related, but it is always something we find that is of informational use to you. We do this so we can keep you up to speed on the market and keep you well-versed on what is happening.

In addition to this, there are some other events we have during the year for our client appreciation program. **We have our annual client party, we do pie giveaways, photos with Santa, balloon races, and more.**

You do not have to be someone who is currently in the market to buy or sell a home to be part of our client appreciation program. **Some of our best clients are people who have never bought or sold a home.** They just do a good job of referring people to us so that we can provide them the information that they need.

We are not here to force you to buy or sell a home. **We are just trying to get you the information you need so you can make the best real estate decisions for yourself.** It doesnâ€™t have to be real estate information either, we have people calling us looking for restaurants, babysitters, and more.

If you are not part of our client appreciation program, or if you think you know someone who might be interested, we just need a few things to get you started: your name, email address, physical address, and phone number. Once we receive this information, we can start providing all the information to keep you up to speed on what is going on out there.

If you have any other questions in the meantime, please feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.on.
