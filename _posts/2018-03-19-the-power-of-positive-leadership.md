If you’re in a position of leadership, no matter what type of position that is, I believe it’s important that you be a positive person.

**Anyone who spends time with me either at home or at work knows that I’m an upbeat, positive person most of the time.** Why do I think this is so important? Let me give you an example.

My son just finished his third year of playing college basketball, but he decided to give up his scholarship and his basketball career because the environment around that career was very negative and the leadership aspect at the head it of wasn’t fantastic.

If you’re in any type of leadership position and you’re struggling with how to handle it, **I recommend you read “The Energy Bus” and “The Power of Positive Leadership” by Jon Gordon.** These two books are great resources for the topic of leadership and I believe they can help you a lot.

If you’d like a copy of one of these books, give me a call and I’d be glad to send you one and talk to you about leadership. If you have any other questions about this topic or you have any real estate needs I can assist you with, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
