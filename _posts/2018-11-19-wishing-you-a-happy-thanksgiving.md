Thanksgiving is tomorrow, and now is the perfect time for us to tell you how grateful we are for everything you’ve done for us. It was great to see everyone who came to pick up a pie at our recent pie giveaway, and if you missed out on the chance to swing by, don’t forget that we’ll be hosting a “Photos With Santa” event on December 1. We wish you a happy Thanksgiving and hope you share a great time with good friends, good family, and of course, good food.
