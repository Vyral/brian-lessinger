<center>If you&rsquo;re planning to sell your house on the market, it&rsquo;s critical that you provide adequate access to it. Here&rsquo;s what I mean.</center>

&nbsp;

The easier we can make it for buyers to see your home, the better. Most agents use those blue Supra Lockboxes that we put on front doors to hold your keys. They’re very safe and they’re necessary for agents to access your house, but **it’s important to make sure your home is relatively easy to unlock.** Sometimes, we’ll turn the key to the front door for a showing and the lock is tight or won’t turn at all, making it hard to get inside. This leaves a bad taste in buyers’ mouths before they even walk in the front door.

As the home seller,&nbsp; we not only want to make sure that you’re notified about when showings are requested, but also **that you’re making it easy for the buyer to see your house**. Now, most buyers can go online to see listing photos of homes they’re interested in, but in my 20 years of working in real estate, it’s a rare thing to see people buy a home that they’ve never physically walked through.

That in mind, it’s important that you give permission to your agent to call you/leave a message saying something like, “Jim Smith from ABC Realty is coming to see your home tomorrow between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m.” After you’ve been notified, we could then have the conversation about what you’d need to do to prepare for the showing, as well as what you’d need to do during that showing time.

When sellers or their agents are restrictive about showing homes, it can really limit potential buyers’ abilities to see your home, and by extension, **it can limit the likelihood of your home selling in your desired time frame at the price you’re asking.**
