When consulting with homebuyers early in the buying process, I find that many of them are preoccupied with their budget. I’ve got news for you, though: You need to set those concerns aside and **focus on getting pre-approved first.&nbsp;**

I’m not telling you to call Quicken Loans and receive an instant pre-approval over the phone. I’m talking about meeting with a mortgage lender face to face and providing them with all pertinent financial information, including your tax returns and pay stubs. **A high-quality lender will do a credit check and whatever else is necessary to get you pre-approved so that no surprises come up late in the game.&nbsp;**

Recently, I’ve been involved in a few transactions where the seller I was representing received an offer accompanied by a pre-approval letter. After the fact, we discovered that the lender never did a thorough analysis of the buyer’s financial situation, and instead opted to take their word for it upon receiving whatever documents the buyer provided. You can guess what happened as a result: Halfway through the transaction, an issue with the buyer’s credit came to light, causing the lender to deny them the loan. &nbsp; &nbsp;

This is a situation both buyers and sellers want to avoid, so let’s talk about how a pre-approval will make the process much smoother. Above all, **being pre-approved will help you understand what your budget is.** Once we know what you can spend, we’ll know what areas of Northern Nevada we can look in.&nbsp;

If you have any additional questions or would like to know more about getting pre-approved before your home purchase, please reach out to The Lessinger Team. We’d be happy to meet with you and point in the direction of a reputable lender to get this taken care of. We’ll talk to you soon\!&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
