Scamming attempts are becoming more and more frequent these days. Any way people can try to get your money, it’s been tried, and there are so many ways it can happen—yes, even to you. Today I want to discuss one of the more common scam tactics so that you can stay on your toes and avoid becoming a victim.

**Sometimes, scammers will find a vacant house and look for someone who will pay them to rent it.** It’s possible to look up people’s names in the tax records, so these scammers will use that information to create an ad for a house for sale or rent. They’ll collect unwitting applicants’ personal information in the process, and have them send money to their own accounts.<br><br>They’re very thorough, as well; they’ll create believable logos for the emails they send, and create stories about being a member of one’s church or something similar. People who don’t know otherwise are often ready to send checks to the scammer.

One of my clients who had fallen for this cruel trick called me in a panic, as he’d already sent the scammer his personal information—**Social Security numbers, bank account information, a copy of his credit card, his driver’s license information, etc.** I figured it out for him relatively quickly, but it’s still a scary situation; I was less concerned about the prospect of my client sending him money than I was about the fact that the scammer now had his private information.

The moral of the story is to **always make sure you’re reaching out to a professional if you’re looking to rent or buy.** If you’re suspicious about an interaction you’re having with a renter, or if you’re just looking for a property rent, reach out and give us a call. We’ll be able to help you figure out whether or not the person you’re contacting is trustworthy and we can put you in the right place. Hope to hear from you soon!
