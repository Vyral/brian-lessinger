I was with a client recently who was considering selling their home after they found a new one to buy first. With a possible winter home sale in their future, they wanted to know when the best time would be to take pictures of their home.

**The truth is that winter is hit or miss when it comes to pictures.** Some days the light is great and it’s a beautiful day, but other times it’s not so great.&nbsp;

If you are considering selling anytime this fall or winter, please reach out to me today. **I’d love to help you take pictures of your home now in early fall while it looks great and the grass is still green.** It’s always better to have these pictures ready just in case you have a winter sale in your future as well.

If you have any questions for me about selling your home or about anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
