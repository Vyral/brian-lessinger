Do you plan on buying or selling a home in 2018? If so, the Lessinger Team is here to help you reach your real estate goals.

If you are thinking of buying or selling a home in 2018, it’s important that you work with an experienced real estate team.

We work with a lot of people who were referred to a different Realtor or worked with an agent that was a friend or family member. Whatever the case may be, in today’s market, you need an agent or team that has experience.

In addition to helping people buy and sell real estate, our team also handles property management. Between everyone on our team, **we have 70 years of combined experience in real estate.**

Why is experience so important? There are a number of different steps and factors in any real estate transaction. We can help you price your home to sell, figure out how much to offer on a home, and guide you through negotiations and repairs. There are a number of details to keep track of, not to mention mountains of paperwork. Thanks to our experience, we know exactly what needs to be done.

We also understand our local market conditions. We can help you through a buyer’s market or a seller’s market. Reno has had a lot of growth over the last five years, and we get a lot of questions from people who are concerned that prices are too high.  

**We can sit down with you and help you decide if now is a good time to buy or sell,** or if you would be better doing so later on.

Our goal is to give you the information you need to make a good decision, whether you buy or sell in 2018 or down the road. We want to do what’s best for you.

If you have any questions or would like to sit down and talk with us about your real estate goals, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us. If you know anyone who is thinking about buying or selling a home in 2018, we would love to meet them and give them the information they need to make the right decisions.

Just give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!
