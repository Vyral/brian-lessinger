Today I want to go over a few things I think could be helpful to you and your business. These are the same resources I’ve utilized myself and I want to share them with you.

Today’s topic is going to be a little different. I’d like to take some time to talk about coaching, mentoring, and also some books I think could be helpful to you.

Here at the Lessinger Team, we work closely with the Buffini Company. Through them, I have my own real estate coach. Most of the systems I use come from them.

**These same systems and tools would likely be beneficial to you,** whether your business is real estate or something else.  

You can find information about these systems in Brian Buffini’s book, “The Emigrant Edge.” This book has been a valuable resource to me and my business, and I want to share it with you. **I’ve got 20 free copies that I’m giving away.** To secure your copy, give me a call or send me an email.

You can also find and buy this book, which is now a bestseller, on Amazon.

I also have another book recommendation for a different topic I often get questions about. If you need financial planning advice, you may want to take a look at “The Automatic Millionaire” by David Bach.

This book is a great wealth of information for those who don’t know much about finances right now. If you are a little more advanced in your knowledge, I’d be happy to recommend some other books to you as well.

**Just like “The Emigrant Edge,” I also have copies of “The Automatic Millionaire” that I would be more than happy to give you.**

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
