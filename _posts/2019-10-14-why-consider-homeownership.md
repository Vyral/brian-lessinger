When it comes to talking about the reasons to consider homeownership, many people seem to forget one of the key reasons: **It’s a forced savings account.**

A lot of people have a hard time saving up money, but when you make your house payment every month, a certain portion goes toward paying off the principal and the interest. **That means you’re building up equity each month.**

{% include pullquote.html %}

Believe it or not, 37% of homes in the United States are owned free and clear, and **25% of homes have at least 50% equity in their property.** Building off my last video’s topic about potential recession concerns, if people are worried that their home will be worth less in the next couple of years, they need to remember that real estate is a long-term game—you shouldn’t worry about your house being worth less next summer, but rather what it’s worth in the next five to 10 years.

If you have any questions about what this all means, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be glad to speak with you.<br>&nbsp;
