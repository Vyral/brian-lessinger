In taking a closer look at the year-end market, you’ll notice that we’re in the course of a shift: Homes are sitting on the market for longer and the power seems to be in the hands of buyers for a change—a change that hasn’t occurred in the last six or seven years, actually.  

**Despite the doomsday commentary you see or hear from various media sources, the reality is that the market is doing well.** Sellers will certainly need to step up their game and be sure that they’re pricing appropriately, but we’ve moved into what I like to call a “professional real estate market.”

In other words, those not working in real estate in a full-time residential capacity will not fare as well under these conditions due to their inexperience with homes sitting on the market for longer periods or working with homes whose listing prices have fallen a bit.

**So it’s all the more reason to place your trust in the skills of professional agents with a strong grasp of our Reno/Sparks market.  **

If you want to know what your home or rental property is worth or about the state of our market in greater detail, please call or email us today. We’d love to get you any and all information that you need to make informed decisions now and into 2019. Happy Holidays and see you in the new year!
