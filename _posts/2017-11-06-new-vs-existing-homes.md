When it comes to deciding whether to buy an existing home or building a new one, there are a lot of variables to think about. Here are my thoughts about choosing what to do.

Today’s topic is two-fold: I’m asked all the time if it’s cheaper to buy or build a house, and also whether it’s better to buy a new or existing home. I’ll be discussing the answers to both of these questions.

**“Is it cheaper to buy a house, or build it from scratch?”**

A pro of building a house from scratch is that you are allowed to pick the details and features that you want, such as the floor plan and certain other amenities. I always think it’s a little more expensive to build a home, and I myself wouldn’t look forward to picking from the thousands of little details necessary when building a home.

With the events that happened recently in Florida, Texas, and California, I believe hiring people to do the work will be more expensive than normal, as will the cost of materials. So many people need to have their houses rebuilt due to hurricanes, floods, and wildfires.

“Is it better to buy a new home, or an existing home?”

New construction is a little like buying a new car. **You’ll have to pay a premium** because it’s a brand-new property, no one has lived in it, and projects like landscaping will need to be done after the fact. If you can find a similar home that’s maybe three to five years old in a similar neighborhood, you’ll find a lot of those things have already been taken care of.

There are a lot of variables to consider when you’re thinking about buying versus building, and new versus existing homes. **It all depends on what your specific needs are** and what you’re willing and able to pay for.

If you’re trying to weigh the options for these scenarios, let me know. I know a bunch of people who have recently built homes from scratch. I’ve also got clients that are buying existing homes. We’ll always give you advice on which option is best for you.

Give us a call, send an email, or make an appointment and we can walk you through those different topics. Hope to talk to you soon!
