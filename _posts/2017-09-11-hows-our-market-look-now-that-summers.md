Our market cooled off a bit during the summer, but now that that’s ending, things should get back to normal.

If I haven’t spoken to you recently, I’m sure you’re hearing all sorts of things about our market. Here’s what’s really going on, though.

**Over the summer—just like the last four or five years—the market cooled off a bit.** Kids are only out of school for about eight weeks now, so a lot of people prefer to go on vacation during June, July, and August. This means houses that have been hitting the market have been taking a bit longer to sell.

To me, that’s not a market correction. That just means things have calmed down a little bit. Now that kids are back in school and people are back into their normal routines and looking for houses again, the market should get going again. We literally just listed two houses that both received offers within the first 48 hours of being on the market.

**Home prices have elevated, but in general homes are still priced pretty well.** Since rents have gone up so much, you can still buy a house for a lower payment than if you decided to rent.

If you want to know the value of your home or you’re thinking of buying or selling in our market soon, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to help you.
