  hold ourselves to a firm ethical code. Today we’d like to share a little bit
  of information regarding what sets us apart.

If you were to open up the Google homepage right now and search “Realtors are…” you would be amazed to see what the most common search results are for that phrase. Suggestions like “Realtors are scum,” “Realtors are a joke,” and even “Realtors are liars,” will all pop up as you type.

At the Lessinger Team, we take this very seriously. **We do everything in our power to subvert these negative stereotypes and hold ourselves to a higher standard.** We believe that Realtors exist to serve communities—to help families buy and sell homes. We operate under a strong code of ethics because we truly care about serving our clients.

No matter if you refer us to a friend or family member who’s just looking around, or if you yourself task us with the job of selling your own home, we are here for you. **We will never pressure you into something you don’t want.** We just want to provide you the information and resources you need.

If you have any other questions, would like more information, or would like to learn more about what sets us apart as real estate agents, feel free to give us a call. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
