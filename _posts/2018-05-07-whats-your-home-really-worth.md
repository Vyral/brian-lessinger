There are several ways you can get an estimate of your home’s worth, but the best way is to give us a call.

If you want to know what your home is worth, how can you find out? There are a few different methods.

**The best way is to reach out to us so we can give you a full comparative market analysis.** Depending on your needs, it’s typically best for me to take a look at your home in person and give it a walk-through. Two homes can look exactly the same from the outside, but one could be worth $50,000 more for a variety of reasons. Obviously, our valuation process is a little different if we’re getting your home ready for sale.

Other ways you can get a valuation of your home include: **getting an appraisal, getting a BPO (broker price opinion), or using Zillow.**

To me, using one of Zillow’s Zestimates is a terrible way to estimate your home’s value. Zillow doesn’t actually look inside or around your home to calculate its value, and its features, upgrades, landscaping, etc., can all play a role in its value.

So again, if you want the most accurate valuation of your home you can possibly get, give us a call and we’d be happy to give you the information you need.

As always, if you have any other questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you.
