With all the talk out there about the “demise of the real estate market,” many people are wanting to know what their homes are worth. Whether you’re worried about recent headlines or you’re wanting to jump into the market, **reach out to us and we can find out your home’s value.**

Having an idea of what your home is worth is perfect for when you’re looking to refinance or wanting to know how much equity you have.

When you ask us to valuate your home, we’ll typically take a look at your house in order to find comparable homes. We can look at the sales of these similar homes to accurately find your own home’s worth.

**If you’re worried about how clean your home is, don’t be!** We understand there may be toys on the floor, kids running around, and so on. None of it goes into consideration during a valuation because, after all, you’re not trying to sell it yet.

Again, if you’d like to know the value of your home, reach out to us—we’ll give you a much better idea than Zillow and other real estate websites ever could. Also feel free to contact us if you have any questions or need more information. In the meantime, we look forward to hearing from you soon.
