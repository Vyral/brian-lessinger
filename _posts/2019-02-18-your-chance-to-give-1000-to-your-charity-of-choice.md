We’ve officially started our new charity program, which means with your participation, your favorite charity might receive $1,000.

Here’s how it works: For every 10 transactions we close, we’ll throw the names of the people involved in those transactions into a hat and pick a name. This includes the buyers, sellers, and/or the people who referred them to us, so we could have up to 20 names for each drawing. **For whoever’s name we pick out of the hat, we’ll donate $1,000 to the charity of their choice.**

So if you buy or sell a home with us or send us a referral, you have a chance to win. If you know anyone who’d like to participate in this program or who could benefit from receiving our newsletters or watching our video blog, don’t hesitate put them in touch with us.  

If you have any other questions about this program, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We’d love to help, and we look forward to making some donations!
