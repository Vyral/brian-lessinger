I can help you find a real estate agent for you almost anywhere, not just Nevada, and today I want to prove it to you.

I’m often asked if I’m able to assist clients in out-of-state areas like Lake Tahoe and cities in California. Now, **my team and I are licensed to operate in the state of Nevada**, so I can only personally help you if you’re in the state.

For those of you who want to buy a rental property in another state or have family members out of state who don’t have real estate representation, **you can still reach out to me.** We can help you find someone to assist you in your future transactions. **I have access to a great network of agents all over the country.**

I’ve helped a family in New York this way, and I’ve also helped a family member move to Virginia. We can find you a real estate agent pretty much anywhere.

If you ever have the need to find an agent out of the state or if you have any real estate questions for me, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you out.
