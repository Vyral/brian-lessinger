When I first got into real estate, our communication with our clients was pretty basic and mostly consisted of phone calls and emails. These days, there are a million different ways you can communicate and it can seem overwhelming.

I would love to hear about what your favorite way to be communicated with is. Whether it’s by phone, text, email, Facebook, Instagram, or some other app or service, I want to know.

As a team, we’re making a big push going forward to reach out to all of you and find out what your preferred communication method is these days. Whether you’re 20, 50, or 80, we want to know how you communicate because everyone communicates differently.

So reach out to us today by giving us a phone call or sending us an email, and we’ll be sure to note your response and make sure that we communicate in the way you want.

If you have any other real estate needs or real estate questions in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
