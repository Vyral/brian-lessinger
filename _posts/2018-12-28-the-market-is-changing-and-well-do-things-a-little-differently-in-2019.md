As we enter 2019, we at the Lessinger Team plan on doing things a little differently this year than we did in past years, and our goal is a little loftier than what we’ve done before, too.

Our goal is to help 10 families a month buy and sell real estate. We’d love your help in achieving this goal, so **if you know anyone looking to buy or sell a home, go ahead and send them our way.**

How we generate our business and how we take care of our clients will remain the same in 2019, but we’re making some changes to our marketing. As we mentioned in our [last video](/our-year-end-market-and-what-it-all-means.html), the market is changing here in Northern Nevada. We’ll still have a strong market moving forward, but it will look a little different than what we saw the past five or six years.

That being said, **we’d love it if you got in touch with us so we have your best and most accurate contact information.** Whether it’s addresses, phone numbers, emails, or social media, we plan on interacting with our friends and clients more often.

We look forward to hopefully seeing you in person this year, and we hope you have an amazing start to 2019. As always, if you ever have any real estate needs at all, don’t hesitate to call or email me. I’d be happy to help you.
