At the beginning of the year, interest rates were expected to rise numerous times in 2019. Now, however, it’s safe to say that things have changed.&nbsp;

**Over the last month or so, rates fell hard, and they’re currently at the lowest point they’ve been in a couple of years.** This is good news for both buyers and sellers.&nbsp;

If you’re a buyer and you can lock in a 30-year rate, you’ll get a nice, low rate. If you’re a seller, a lot of buyers who were on the fence about buying will now be out in full force.&nbsp;

If you’re a homeowner looking to refinance, this is also good news. If your current mortgage rate is in the 5% range, it might make sense for you to spend the money to refinance so that you can save on your monthly mortgage cost. We’d be happy to advise you on this and we know plenty of great lenders we can put you in touch with, so don’t hesitate to give us a call.

In the meantime, we’ll be covering more important financial topics in the near future and giving away some free books, so stay tuned.&nbsp;

If you have any more questions about interest rates or any other real estate topic, feel free get ahold of me any way you can.&nbsp;
