Recently, many listings are tending to spend more time on the market before being found by a buyer. And until that perfect buyer comes along and closes on the property, sellers need to make sure their listing is in perpetual show-ready condition. This way, they’re always ready to make a great first impression. So how can you achieve this? It actually depends on whether you’re still living in the home.

If the home is vacant, keep the utilities on and hire landscapers to take care of the property. Depending on how long the home sits vacant on the market, it may also be a good idea to hire a housekeeper to do some periodic cleaning.

If you’re still living in the home, though, you will need to be even more vigilant in keeping your home tidy and ready to show. Even after the home is under contract, you need to keep it looking like a model home until the buyer takes possession.
