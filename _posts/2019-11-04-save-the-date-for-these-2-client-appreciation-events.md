<center><em>To show our appreciation to you, you&rsquo;re invited to two of our upcoming client appreciation events.</em></center>

&nbsp;

To those who have worked with us over the years, we always like to show our appreciation for all the referrals and the opportunities to help people buy and sell houses.

On that note, we have a couple of upcoming client appreciation events that we’d love to see you attend:

**On Tuesday, November 26, we’ll be doing our annual pie giveaway.** Hopefully, by now you’ve received your invitations to RSVP for your free pies in time for Thanksgiving. If you haven’t received your invitation or you haven’t yet RSVPed, you can do so by sending me an email at rsvp@thelessingerteam.com. Please RSVP by November 18th.

The following week **on Saturday, December 7th, we’ll be hosting our annual photoshoot with Santa Claus**. Be sure to bring your friends and family\! Again please RSVP by sending us an email at rsvp@thelessingerteam.com. Please RSVP by December 4th.

Once again, we thank you for your support over the years, and we hope to see you at our upcoming holiday events\!

As always, if you have any questions or real estate needs, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help you.
