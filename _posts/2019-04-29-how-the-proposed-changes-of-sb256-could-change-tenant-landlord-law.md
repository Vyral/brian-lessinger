The proposed changes of [SB256](https://www.leg.state.nv.us/App/NELIS/REL/80th2019/Bill/6434/Overview){: target="_blank"} would affect laws for tenants and landlords in a few different ways. 

These changes are not yet laws, but lawmakers are trying to revise some current landlord and tenant laws in order to make them more tenant-friendly.

Right now, if a tenant moves out, the landlord has 30 days to return their portion of the deposit. **After the change, landlords would only have 14 days to do so.** We can barely get it done in 30 days already—we never know what kinds of repairs need to be done.

In addition, changes to eviction timelines and rent control are being discussed as well. I know a lot of people want to live here in Nevada instead of California because we don’t have or want rent control. I’ve always said that if you want rent control, it’s better to buy a home instead of rent one anyway. 

**Here’s what will happen if SB256 is passed:**

* Landlords will charge higher rents
* More lawsuits will occur between tenants and landlords
* There will be overall less housing as more property owners close up shop
