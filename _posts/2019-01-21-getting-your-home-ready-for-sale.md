If you plan on putting your home on the market soon, there are a few things you need to prepare so that it sells quickly and for top dollar.

First, since it’s winter and your home might be covered in snow or its landscaping might not look the best, **try using exterior listing photos from a different time of year.** Otherwise, shovel the snow off your driveway and all your walkways, polish up your landscaping, and make the outside look as approachable as possible.

On the inside, **make your home look like a model home.** This means cleaning, decluttering, and packing up anything you don’t need to make it look more spacious.

Depending on how long you’ve lived in your home, **you might want to consider doing a presale inspection or deferred maintenance.** If you have any repairs that you’ve been putting off, you want to get as many of those done as possible before the buyer does their home inspection.

If you’d like to know what else you can do to prepare your home for the market or you have any other real estate needs I can take care of, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
