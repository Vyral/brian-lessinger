Today I will be discussing the first of six advantages to owning real estate.

Today’s video begins my six-part series about the advantages that come with owning real estate.

The first advantage I thought of was the fact that **it is easier to understand and control your real estate investment**—be it your primary residence or a rental property—than, say, an investment in the stock market or retirement account.

I always tell people this: You have to live somewhere. If you own your property, you have control over your monthly payment, location, and more. If you are renting out a property you own, you can always hire a property manager. **The downsides to renting are the complications that arise when you want to sell the property, not to mention that rents are rising dramatically, especially in the Reno-Sparks area.**

Over the course of this series, I will explain other advantages of owning real estate. If you have any questions in the meantime, feel free to reach out to me. Otherwise, until next time!
