Is it better to rent a property or own one? We will discuss this today in the fourth installment into our six-part series on the advantages of owning real estate.

Today marks the fourth installment of our series on the advantages of owning real estate, and, this time, we will be going even deeper into the subject. Specifically, I would like to share some advice about when purchasing a home is the superior option to renting.

**If you plan on living in a property for at least five to seven years, I highly recommend ownership over the rental lifestyle.** Renting can be a good, non-permanent living situation, but it is far better to have a home of your own if you are staying put for some time.

As you may remember from previous installments in this series, buying a house is the best way to control your living situation and leverage your money into building up a long-term asset. If you pay down the mortgage on your house and achieve a lower debt ratio, the propertyâ€™s value will steadily increase.

**There will be some maintenance-related expenses, but homeownership is, overall, a worthwhile investment.**

So, if you have been renting for some time and are ready to make the transition into owning real estate and want to know more about the home buying process, feel free to reach out.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
