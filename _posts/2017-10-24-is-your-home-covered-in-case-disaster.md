If you’re not sure you have the right homeowners insurance, talk to your insurance agent immediately and get that corrected so if disaster strikes, you don’t make a bad situation worse.

Today’s topic hits somewhat close to home for me. The topic I'm talking about is making sure you have the right homeowners insurance in case disaster strikes.

My sister-in-law lives in Santa Rosa in Northern California, and her entire neighborhood burned to the ground recently due to the wildfires. I also have a cousin who lives in Tampa who had to deal with effects and aftermath of Hurricane Irma.

Between the wildfires in California, the storms in Florida, and the flooding in Houston, I figured now is as good of a time as any to remind you to **talk to your insurance agent about your homeowners insurance policy and make sure you have the protection you think you do**—whether that’s for earthquakes, flooding, wildfires, etc. Many times, certain things aren’t covered that you think might be. Also, make sure you have enough insurance so that if your house is destroyed, you have enough money to rebuild it, repair it, or have a place to stay in the meantime.

I’ve watched so many horrendous things happen over the last few months, so make sure your policies are paid, up to date, and in place so that you have what you think you need.

If you don’t have the homeowners insurance you think you need, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be glad to help you.
