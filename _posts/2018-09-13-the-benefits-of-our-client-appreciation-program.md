Most of you who are reading this are already a part of our client appreciation program. However, for those of you who aren’t,&nbsp;**we wanted to explain what this program is and the benefits you’ll see from joining if you haven’t yet.**<br><br>First, we send a piece of mail each month about a real estate-related topic, which also includes information about houses we’ve listed or an event we have coming up. Then, we send out a video email in the middle of the month that is related to that same general topic.<br><br>In addition, we also send out blog articles like this one that cover questions that we get from people most frequently. If you have friends, family members, or co-workers who you think might be interested in receiving some of this information we are providing, we’d be happy to add them to our client appreciation program.

{% include pullquote.html %}<br><br>**Another huge benefit of joining our program is that you can reach out to us for almost anything.&nbsp;**We work in property management as well, so we know roofers, plumbers, electricians, and any other kind of service provider you might need in your home. We can also give recommendations for things that don’t even have to do with real estate. We know the best restaurants, dentists, babysitters, and more in Reno. I’ve lived here for 29 years now and know the area very well.<br><br>This program benefits us because it allows us to stay in touch with you regularly and help you with any problems you have in your home.&nbsp;<br><br>If you or someone you know might be interested in joining our client appreciation program, all we need is a phone number, an email address, and a home address. We will take it from there.<br><br>If you have any real estate-related questions in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
