I want to discuss two topics today: property management and referrals.

Today’s topic is actually about two separate things: property management and referrals. I wanted to educate you a little bit about some things we do in our property management business that you might not be aware of, as well as about how referrals work since our business is based on them.

**Property Management:**

For those of you who don’t know, The Lessinger Team does do property management. We manage mostly single-family homes, but for local owners and those who are more experienced in property management, **we also do what’s called a tenant finder.** This means we find you the tenant for the property and you manage the property on your own.

**Referrals:**

We let all of our clients know that **any referrals needed don’t necessarily have to be related to the house;** we can get you a referral to a dentist or even something like a babysitter. Feel free to give us a call if you need anything, especially if you’re new to the area.

On the other side of the referral coin, our business is based on referrals. Most of our clients are referred to us. **The best way for you to refer us would be to call or email us directly** with the contact information of the person that might be looking to buy or sell a home. That way, we can reach out to them.

Whether it’s property management or buying or selling a home, **we want to be here to help you get all the information you need.** If you do have any questions or need information, give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!
