If you want to sell your home this fall or winter, there are a few things you should do to prepare your property for the market.

If you plan on listing your home anytime between October and March, there are a few things you should do to prepare for the market.

Depending on the weather, **you may want to take photos of your home now.** Your yard looks great when the grass is green and the trees and plants are in bloom. Right now, your landscape looks great, so take listing photos before the snow comes.

As we approach Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas, a lot of homeowners will start decorating. If you plan on selling your house though, I recommend dialing it back a bit on the decorations. You want people to focus on the positive features of your house, not all the seasonal decor.

Also, since the weather is colder, things like extra blankets and pillows start to come out of storage. It’s important to stay warm, but don’t let your house get too cluttered with extra blankets and such. You don’t want to have so much stuff around that the space is cluttered.

If you are lucky enough to have a gas or wood burning fireplace, make sure that it is in working order and looks great. **A fireplace can be a nice selling point for your property.**

If this winter is like last winter, now is the time to prepare your house for the market. After all, you don’t want to take your listing photos under a couple of feet of snow.

Hopefully, these tips will help you. If you have any questions about selling your particular house this fall or winter, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
