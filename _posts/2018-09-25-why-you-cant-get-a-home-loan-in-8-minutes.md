I was watching TV the other day and a commercial came on saying that they could get me approved for a home loan in as little as eight minutes. Well, I've been working in real estate for a long time and I am here to say that this is not possible.

If someone tells you that they can get you approved in eight minutes, that means that you're just calling an online lender and they are taking your word as fact. I always advise my clients **to speak with an actual lender either on the phone or sit down with them in person and provide them with all the information that they need to get you qualified.**

Doing this will actually let you know what you can afford. Sometimes you can be approved for a loan for much more than you really want to spend. This lets you know what your monthly payments will be as well as your property taxes, insurance, HOA fees, etc.

We recommend that you meet with an actual lender before you start looking for a home if you know that you’ll need a loan. **I promise it will take more than eight minutes, but it will be worth it.**

If you would like us to refer a lender to you, reach out and give us a call or send us an email. We’d be happy to put you in touch with a great lender who can help you get qualified and approved smoothly.

If you have any additional questions about this, or if you’re interested in speaking about buying or selling, please feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
