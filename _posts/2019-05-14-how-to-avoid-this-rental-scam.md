How can you avoid being scammed in a rental transaction? To answer that, I’ll explain how this scam works.&nbsp;

First, scammers will find a home for sale or for rent that’s vacant, then they’ll post an ad for it at a much-reduced price in the hope that they’ll be able to convince you to send them a check in the mail. They’ll then send you the “keys” in return without ever having met you in person.&nbsp;

I’ve had clients find themselves in this type of situation before, and fortunately, they called me before they could be scammed. **If you find yourself in a similar situation, don’t hesitate to give me a call as well.** I’d be happy to look into it for you.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions about this or any other real estate topic, feel free to reach out to me as well. I look forward to hearing from you.&nbsp;
