As someone who’s always meeting with buyer and seller clients, it should come as no surprise that their financial situation pops up in conversation. **I’d like to address the topic of money a little further today.&nbsp;**

I’m often saddened to learn that many older couples and first-timers to the market don’t have a strong financial footing. This is partly attributed to the fact that a basic, introductory conversation about money never takes place in some households. Without any guidance, it’s tough to ever develop an understanding of finances and budgeting.&nbsp;

I was fortunate to be exposed to the basics of money from an early age, I went on to earn a degree in finance, and I once worked as a bank teller. On the Lessinger Team, we view our role as going above and beyond just helping you buy and sell homes: **We want to help you learn about and ask the right questions about money.&nbsp;**

My favorite author on the subject is a guy named David Bach and, by the time you see this video, his new book, **“[The Latte Factor](http://www.thelattefactor.com/3chapter/){: target="_blank"},”** will have hit the shelves. In it, he tells the story of a young woman as she journeys through and learns the ropes of managing money. For those looking for a little guidance, this is a great place to start.&nbsp;

In addition to his new book, his other work includes “**[The Automatic Millionaire](https://www.amazon.com/Automatic-Millionaire-Expanded-Updated-Powerful/dp/0451499085/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3F83QL9AOLHMR&amp;keywords=the+automatic+millionaire%22+by+david+bach&amp;qid=1559068507&amp;s=gateway&amp;sprefix=The+Automatic+%2Caps%2C155&amp;sr=8-1){: target="_blank"}**” and “**[Smart Couples Finish Rich](https://www.amazon.com/Smart-Couples-Finish-Revised-Updated/dp/0525572937/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Smart+Couples+Finish+Rich&amp;qid=1559068575&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-1){: target="_blank"}**.” I have dozens of copies of each, and I’d be happy to meet with you and give you with your very own copy at no cost. Two others that I recommend you check out are “**[The Richest Man in Babylon](https://www.amazon.com/Richest-Man-Babylon-George-Clason/dp/1640950494/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=The+Richest+Man+in+Babylon&amp;qid=1559068599&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;psc=1){: target="_blank"}**” and “**[Think and Grow Rich](https://www.amazon.com/Think-Grow-Rich-Publication-Foundation-ebook/dp/B07P896HSJ/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=Think+and+Grow+Rich&amp;qid=1559068640&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;psc=1){: target="_blank"}**.” &nbsp;&nbsp;

**Ultimately, I want my role to extend past that of the guy who simply helps you buy and sell homes.** If you’re interested in buying one of these books yourself, click on one of the links I've provided. After all, it is graduation season and any one of these books would make a great gift. &nbsp;

If you’d like to meet and talk further about this, I’d be more than happy to do so. Just reach out to me and we can schedule a time to talk soon. I look forward to it\!&nbsp;
