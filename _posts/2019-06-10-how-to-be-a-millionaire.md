A lot of people would like to be a millionaire, but not everyone has the right idea about what this actually means. Being a millionaire doesn’t necessarily mean you have $1 million in cash somewhere in a bank. All it really means to be a millionaire is that you have a net worth that meets or exceeds that amount.&nbsp;

**The key to obtaining “millionaire” status is knowing the right way to spend, save, and earn money.&nbsp;**

Unfortunately, though, the majority of people in our nation live paycheck to paycheck. This is largely because we live in a system designed to make you fail. All you need to do to see that this is true is to turn on your television or radio and pay attention to the kinds of commercials you’re bound to hear. There’s a good reason there are so many ads out there that claim to help soothe your fiscal woes. And the ads that aren’t trying to sell you quick fixes to your financial struggles will try to sell you expensive products or emotional “bandaids” like fast food and alcohol.&nbsp;

As someone with a degree in finance, I’m very passionate about helping as many people as I can to escape this reality and achieve financial comfort. If you’re interested in working toward a more financially stable future for yourself, please reach out to me. **I would be happy to give you a few books on the subject of finance for free, as well as give you a few of my own thoughts on how to manage money well.** To give you a hint, owning property is a great way to build wealth. The average net worth of homeowners, after all, is 46 times greater than that of the average renter.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
