Here’s a quick reminder about some of our upcoming events. This year, we’ve got a lot of great things planned, including our annual Great Reno Balloon Race.

Today I’ve got a quick reminder for you about some of the events we have coming up in the near future.

For one, we’ve got the Great Reno Balloon Race—which we have been holding the past few years on a Friday.

This year, however, we’ve moved the date by request to Saturday, September 9th.

But that’s not all. **For every person who comes out for a free tether balloon ride, we’ll make a donation to the Children’s Miracle Network.**

I’ll be out at this event early, so be sure to come find my team and I so we can help you take advantage of this fun chance to give back.

While things may, of course, change due to weather, the tether balloon rides should start between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m. Remember to come early, since lines tend to form and there are waivers to sign.

On top of that, we will also be having some more events in October and November. **This will include our pumpkin patch event, pie giveaway, Santa Claus photos, and more.** This year, we’re trying out some different things—so be on the lookout for details.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
