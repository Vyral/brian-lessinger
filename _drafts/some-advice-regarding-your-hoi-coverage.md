I’ve talked to a number of my Realtor friends who work in various markets across the country, and they all agree: **If you’re a homeowner, you should be talking to your mortgage insurance company at least once a year to ensure you have proper coverage.**

**Why is this such a vital part of homeownership?&nbsp;**

Well, let’s say you haven’t talked to your insurance agent since you bought your home and homeowners insurance 10 years ago. **In all likelihood, your coverage amount wouldn’t be enough to rebuild your home if a disaster were to strike.&nbsp;**

I’ve had personal experience with this: My sister owned a home in Santa Rosa when the wildfires tore through the area, and the entire neighborhood, including her home, went up in flames.&nbsp;

Fortunately, her plan covered the costs of rebuilding her property and that process is currently underway. Some of her neighbors weren’t so fortunate, though, and are left with no home and a lack of coverage to repair the situation.&nbsp;

This ties right back into our recent discussion of money, and it highlights how important it is to **know the extent of your insurance coverage and protect your largest asset.&nbsp;**
