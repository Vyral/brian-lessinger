When people are trying to figure out the value of their home, they’ll tell me about their home’s Zestimate. What they don’t realize is that this Zestimate is based on an algorithm. **I personally don’t think it works very well for those of you who want an accurate valuation of your home.&nbsp;**

All of the information that you see on Zillow’s website is information that is pulled directly from our Multiple Listing Service. **Zillow then operates by selling advertising to Realtors and trying to drive traffic to their site with features like the Zestimate.** They’ll be the first ones to admit that these Zestimate are not overly accurate.

**When I get a phone call from a home seller about their home’s value, the first thing I want to do is take a look at the home in person.** Zillow never goes out and see any houses.&nbsp;

If you live in a neighborhood like Double Diamond where most of the homes are pretty similar, your Zestimate will be more accurate than most. However, **if you’re in a neighborhood with homes of different ages, styles, and sizes, Zillow has no idea what your home’s true value is.**
